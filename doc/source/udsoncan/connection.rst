Underlying protocol (Connections)
=================================

.. _Connection:

Basics
------

Since UDS is an application layer protocol, it must be used over a data transport protocol. The current industry mostly uses ISO-TP protocol (ISO-15765) over CAN bus (ISO-11898).

Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol is a link layer protocol that sends data over small chunks of 8 bytes. ISO-TP is a transport protocol that allow the transmission of larger frames, usually 4095 bytes maximum although the 2016 version of the standard uses sizes defined over 32bits, which would theoretically allow frames of 4GB.

ISO-TP has been designed to be used for UDS. The current ISO-15765 protocol comes in 4 parts. ISO-15765-2 tells how to transmit large frames and ISO-15765-3 defines how to map the ISO-TP fields to a UDS message.

This project does not implement any communication protocol below the UDS layer, but provides a standard interface to interact with them.

How to
------

Access to the underlying protocol is done through a ``Connection`` object. A user can define his own Connection object by inheriting the ``BaseConnection`` object and implementing the abstract method.

The main interfaces to use with the Connection object are:

.. automethod:: udsoncan.connections.BaseConnection.send
.. automethod:: udsoncan.connections.BaseConnection.wait_frame

Available Connections
---------------------

Some connections are already avaialble and can be imported from the ``udsoncan.connections`` modules. Each of these connections are meant to address a specific use case.

.. warning:: This connection is based on `aioisotp <https://github.com/christiansandberg/aioisotp>`_ which is no longer actively maintained by its author.
    The protocol uses streams rather than datagrams and it still has some `issues <https://github.com/christiansandberg/aioisotp/issues>`_. However, it has
    good performance on Windows.

Defining a new Connection
-------------------------

If all of the above Connection does not suits your needs, you can always implement your own Connection.

In order to define a new connection, 6 methods must be implemented as they will be called by the ``Client`` object.

 .. automethod:: udsoncan.connections.BaseConnection.open
 .. automethod:: udsoncan.connections.BaseConnection.close
 .. automethod:: udsoncan.connections.BaseConnection.specific_send
 .. automethod:: udsoncan.connections.BaseConnection.specific_wait_frame
 .. automethod:: udsoncan.connections.BaseConnection.empty_rxqueue
 .. automethod:: udsoncan.connections.BaseConnection.is_open
